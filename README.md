# Project "Personal Links Portal"

This is a simple SPA to be used as a personal links portal (as an analogous replacement for simply using browser-based links & folders).

The intent of this project is to gain familiarity with the Angular framework & related technologies (Typescript, CSS/SCSS, etc).

# To-Dos (in no particular order):

* Establish a cloud-based back-end data store for the links, their data & a simple user list (for access control & CRUD operations of categories, links and users).
* Create a CRUD operations UI for managing categories, links and users.
** When adding new links, implement link target metadata scraping & facilitate auto-populating the title, description, etc. based on that metadata.
* Make the UI dynamic so that there can be different types of category representations (not just link panels).
** Link panels
** Button drop-lists
** Link bars
** Other...?
* Authentication/Authorization support.
* Implement a global search bar. This will allow for searching of all link lists & will show matches in their respective categories.
